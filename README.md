For accessing GCP resources, it recommended to use pre-authenticated images from AWS ECR. Each project, 'Pratilipi Test' & 'Pratilipi Platform', will have pre-authenticated images for all commonly used docker images.

Follow this guide to authorize your docker engine to access AWS ECR - http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecr/get-login.html
